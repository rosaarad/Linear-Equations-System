With the first input (as n) being the number of equations, we then receive the equations in the following "n" lines.
After calculating the variables, the output should be print out as the following format (in this example weonly have x and y as variables): x=1.00 | y=2.00
The input of this example is the following for more reference:
2
+3x-4y=-5
+1y-2x=00
